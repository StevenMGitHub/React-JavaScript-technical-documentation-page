                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters. 
                    <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                </p>
                <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
                <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable. </p>
                <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example: 
                    <code>{'// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}'}; const f = 5; // THIS
                        WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { '{const g = 5; var g; //statements}' }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems. 
                    <code>const MY_OBJECT = {'{"key": "value"}'}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
                    </code>
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
